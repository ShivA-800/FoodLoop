# 🥗 MealBridge – Connecting Surplus Food with Communities

**MealBridge** is a lightweight, community-driven web platform that connects food donors (restaurants, events, or individuals) with nearby volunteers who redistribute surplus meals to those in need. Built with **React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**, it reduces food waste and supports vulnerable communities through fast and simple coordination.

---

## 🚀 Elevator Pitch
**MealBridge** transforms surplus meals into social good by enabling donors to post food instantly and volunteers to claim and deliver it — reducing waste, fighting hunger, and empowering communities.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement
Every day, millions of people go hungry while tons of edible food are discarded. Complex logistics and lack of coordination prevent excess meals from reaching those who need them. **MealBridge** bridges this gap with a **lightweight, decentralized platform** where anyone can donate, claim, and redistribute food in real time — without needing costly infrastructure.

- ✅ **Pickup confirmation flow** – Smooth process from posting → claiming → delivering
